                    <ul>
                        <li>Any damage caused by the impact due to a fall or accident.</li>
                        <li>Aesthetic (scratches, cracks, etc.) or functional damage owing to impact from road detritus or impact with the ground or solid objects during the use or transport of the helmet or inadequate use of components and accessories (visors, peaks, etc.).</li>

                        <li>Inadequate adjustment: it is the userâ€™s responsibility to ensure a proper adjustment at the time of purchase.</li>

                        <li>Aging due to the normal wear of internal fibres or foam, and the visual aspect of exterior parts or visors (scratches, marks, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Loss of color intensity or wearing out of the colors (especially Neon and Mate) due to prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light, decorative lights, inclement weather, or various other sources and types of dirt.</li>
                        <li>Any visors and spoilers do not come under warranty.</li>

                        Modifying your helmet may increase your risk of serious injury or death in an accident. Do not modify your helmet. Modifications include the following:

                        <li>Drilling holes.</li>

                    <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                        To prolong the usable life of your helmet, you must clean it regularly. This does not mean a full strip-down wash every time, that level of clean can be reserved for once or maybe twice a season. More frequent, routine cleanings can be as simple as a quick wipe down with a wet towel, or a limited wash of the easily removable parts.
                    </Typography>

                    <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                        After every ride, we encourage you to wipe the residual sweat from the surface of the interior lining. If you use sunblock, makeup, or hair products, you may want to pull out the cheek pads and headliner and give them a quick rinse in the sink.
                    </Typography>

                    <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                        Do not use polishes on helmets with matte finish paintwork; simply use a mild detergent and water for cleaning. Heavily soiled areas can be gently cleaned using a soft toothbrush or a cotton swab.
                    </Typography>

                    <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                        All removable parts of the interior comfort liner should be removed and washed by hand. Fixed padding should be wiped with a damp cloth, again using only a neutral cleaning agent. Antibacterial detergents have proven useful in removing smells.
                    </Typography>

                    <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                        Although we recommend changing a helmet every 3 to 5 years, the accumulation of sweat, humidity, and dirt can deteriorate the fabric and stitching, and this may cause odor. Dirt and debris can find their way into the venting of your Soulmate Helmet. It is recommended that you remove any removable pads before using compressed air to blow debris from the ventilation system.
