                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                    Once the digital warranty is registered, the customers can start the claim process any time within the warranty period by <Link style={{ color: "white" }} href="https://Soulmate.genuinemark.org/web/customer/" target="_blank">clicking on the link here</Link> or approaching the store where they bought the helmet with a valid purchase invoice. For the warranty-related complaint to be considered, the buyer must notify the Store about the problem, presenting the proof of purchase invoice. Soulmate Helmets shall evaluate it.
                </Typography>

                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                    If the warranty is activated, Soulmate Helmets shall do everything in its power to rapidly assist the client; however, it must be noted that the length of the assistance period shall depend on the technical evaluation of the product, with a maximum duration of 15 days (counting from the date of receival of the product).
                </Typography>

                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                    Soulmate Helmets shall return any product immediately if the client fails to respect the methods and time limits foreseen in the attendant legislation relative to the communication of the warranty activation; or if the product is not properly packaged and accompanied by a copy of the proof of purchase document. Soulmate Helmets is not responsible for any damage suffered by the product during its transport due to insufficient packaging.
                </Typography>

                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>

                </Typography>

                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                    Warranty is limited to manufacturing defects for 1 Year only from the purchase invoice date. Soulmate Helmets cannot be held responsible concerning the product, nor is the company liable for any warranty, in the following cases:
                </Typography>

                <ol>
                    <li>Any damage caused by the impact due to a fall or accident.</li>
                    <li>Aesthetical (scratches, cracks, etc) or functional damage owing to impact from road detritus or impact with the ground or solid objects during the use or transport of the helmet or inadequate use of components and accessories (visors, peaks, etc).</li>
                    <li>Damage or wear of interior linings resulting from normal use and/or abuse.</li>
                    <li>Alterations and/or installation of accessories that do not belong to Soulmate (Glue, adhesive products, paints, fasteners, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Inadequate adjustment: it is the userâ€™s responsibility to ensure a proper adjustment at the time of purchase.</li>
                    <li>Use of or contact with harmful chemicals or exposure to sources of intense heat.</li>
                    <li>Inadequate use: abnormal conditions (for example, immersion in water), lack of maintenance or care, inadequate handling or packaging, improper handling of components or accessories such as visors, peaks, etc.</li>
                    <li>Aging due to the normal wear of internal fibres or foam, and the visual aspect of exterior parts or visors (scratches, marks, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Loss of color intensity or wearing out of the colors (especially Neon and Mate) due to prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light, decorative lights, inclement weather, or various other sources and types of dirt.</li>
                    <li>Any visors and spoilers do not come under warranty.</li>
                </ol>

                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                    The occurrence of any of the aspects referred to above absolves the Soulmate Helmets brand of any responsibility. Apart from these cases, Soulmate Helmets cannot consider the following subjective situations as being defects covered by the warranty: aesthetic nuances, problems related to comfort, size, noises or small-scale resonance, aerodynamics, etc.
                </Typography>

                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                    Warranties will be invalidated if the product is used or washed in a manner that is not appropriate for the product or in line with the instructions/warnings given in this respect by the seller, or as specified in the reference presentation material, on the tags or the labels.
                </Typography>

                    DO NOT MODIFY YOUR HELMET
                </Typography>

                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                    Modifying your helmet may increase your risk of serious injury or death in an accident. Do not modify your helmet. Modifications include the following:
                </Typography>

                <ul>
                    <li>Drilling holes.</li>
                    <li>Cutting shell, liner, or strap.</li>
                    <li>Modifying the retention system, including adding a chin cup.</li>
                    <li>Removing parts.</li>
                    <li>Painting.</li>
                    <li>Installation of accessories that are not manufactured by Soulmate for this helmet.</li>
                </ul>

                <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>
                    Care & Maintenance
                </Typography>

                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                    To prolong the usable life of your helmet, you must clean it regularly. This does not mean a full strip-down wash every time, that level of clean can be reserved for once or maybe twice a season. More frequent, routine cleanings can be as simple as a quick wipe down with a wet towel, or a limited wash of the easily removable parts.
                </Typography>

                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                    After every ride, we encourage you to wipe the residual sweat from the surface of the interior lining. If you use sunblock, makeup, or hair products, you may want to pull out the cheek pads and headliner and give them a quick rinse in the sink. Build-up of these products can become difficult to remove after a while.
                </Typography>

                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                    Do not use polishes on helmets with matte finish paintwork; simply use a mild detergent and water for cleaning. Heavily soiled areas can be gently cleaned using a soft toothbrush or a cotton swab. The shield and any other parts can be removed for cleaning.
                </Typography>

                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                    All removable parts of the interior comfort liner should be removed and washed by hand. Fixed padding should be wiped with a damp cloth, again using only a neutral cleaning agent. Antibacterial detergents have proven useful in removing smells. The EPS liner can also be wiped down with a mild cleaner. Make sure that everything is dry before putting the padding back into the helmet shell.
                </Typography>

                <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                    Although we recommend changing a helmet every 3 to 5 years, the accumulation of sweat, humidity, and dirt can deteriorate the fabric and stitching, and this may cause odor. Dirt and debris can find their way into the venting of your Soulmate Helmet. Compressed air cans are used to blow the debris from the ventilation system. It is recommended that you remove any removable pads before doing this process set those data in warranty page in Material UI.
